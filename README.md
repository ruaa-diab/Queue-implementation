This project is a Queue implementation in Java, showcasing different approaches to building a queue. It includes various types of classes such as:

ArrayQueue.java: A queue implemented using an array.
LinkedQueue.java: A queue implemented with a linked list.
Queueable.java: A general interface for defining queue operations like enqueue (add an item), dequeue (remove an item), and peek (view the front item without removing it).
Each implementation provides a clear example of how to use queues for different scenarios.
